# Payment Processing Debug Guide

This guide documents the enhanced debugging features implemented for the payment processing flow, helping developers trace and troubleshoot the payment flow from UI interaction through the backend verification process.

## Overview of Payment Flow

The payment processing flow consists of the following steps:

1. User initiates payment from the Checkout page
2. RazorpayService creates a payment order via PaymentApiService
3. Razorpay payment UI is shown to the user
4. User completes payment in Razorpay UI
5. RazorpayService receives payment success callback
6. RazorpayService verifies payment with backend via PaymentApiService
7. Success callback is triggered and user is redirected to success page

## Debugging Features

### Enhanced Logging

Comprehensive logging has been added throughout the payment flow with a consistent format:

- üõí Prefix for Checkout page logs 
- ‚≠êÔ∏è Prefix for RazorpayService logs
- üîµ Prefix for PaymentApiService createOrder logs
- üü¢ Prefix for PaymentApiService verifyPayment logs
- ‚ùå Prefix for error logs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Prefix for warning logs

All logs include:
- A descriptive message
- Relevant data (amounts, IDs, etc.)
- Stack traces for important method calls
- Timing information for async operations

### Race Condition Fixes

The payment callback flow has been optimized to prevent race conditions:

- Added `_callbackExecuted` flag in RazorpayService to prevent duplicate callbacks
- Modified callback flow to ensure success callbacks are only called after verification
- Added protection against error callbacks being triggered after success callbacks
- Improved error handling in verification flow

## Key Files

1. **checkout_page.dart**: Contains the checkout UI and initiates payment process
2. **razorpay_service.dart**: Handles Razorpay integration and payment callbacks
3. **payment_api_service.dart**: Makes API calls to backend payment service
4. **razorpay_checkout.dart**: WebView implementation for Razorpay checkout

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **API Calls Not Being Made**
   - Check logs with prefix üîµ and üü¢ to verify if API methods are being called
   - Verify JWT token is being correctly retrieved from AuthService
   - Check network connectivity to backend service

2. **Payment Verification Failing**
   - Check logs with prefix üü¢ for verifyPayment calls
   - Verify orderId and paymentId are correctly passed from Razorpay
   - Check backend logs for authentication or processing errors

3. **UI Not Updating After Payment**
   - Check for race conditions in callback handling
   - Verify success callback is being called exactly once
   - Check for errors in the UI navigation code

### Testing the Payment Flow

To test the complete payment flow with enhanced logging:

1. Make a purchase from the checkout page
2. Monitor the console logs with special attention to:
   - üõí Logs showing the payment initiation
   - ‚≠êÔ∏è Logs showing RazorpayService operations
   - üîµ Logs showing createOrder API calls
   - üü¢ Logs showing verifyPayment API calls

3. Verify that both the order creation and payment verification API calls are made
4. Check that the UI correctly transitions to the order success page

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. The payment verification will still mark payment as successful even if backend verification fails, as long as Razorpay confirms success. This is intentional to prevent UX issues.

2. WebView implementation may have timing issues on some devices - the force close timer protects against this by closing the WebView after a set period.

## Recent Fixes

1. Fixed race condition in payment callbacks to prevent duplicate success callbacks
2. Added proper error handling in API calls with detailed logging
3. Fixed JWT token access in payment_api_service.dart (changed from getToken() method to token property)
4. Enhanced debug logging throughout the payment flow
